## Architecture Highlights

### Anti-Rollback Protection (Addresses Critical Feedback #3)

```rust
struct Checkpoint {
    sequence: u64,                // Strictly increasing per robot
    monotonic_counter: u64,       // Hardware-backed TEE counter
    prev_root: Hash256,          // Links to previous checkpoint
    // ... other fields
}
```

**Three-Layer Protection:**
1. **Enclave monotonic counter** (TEE secure storage, can't be decremented)
2. **Previous root chaining** (like blockchain, tampering breaks chain)
3. **Gateway sequence tracking** (rejects out-of-order checkpoints)

### Canonical Serialization (Addresses Critical Feedback #2)

- Uses **Canonical CBOR (RFC 8949)** for deterministic hashing
- Fixed field ordering in all structs
- Verification logic detects non-canonical encoding
- SHA-256 for on-chain commitments (widest compatibility)
- Blake3 for performance-critical off-chain paths

### Attestation Abstraction (Addresses Critical Feedback #1)

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait AttestationAdapter: Send + Sync {
    fn vendor_name(&self) -> &str;
    async fn verify_quote(&self, quote: &[u8], nonce: Option<&[u8]>)
        -> Result<AttestationResult, AttestationError>;
    async fn check_revocation(&self, measurement: &[u8])
        -> Result<RevocationStatus, AttestationError>;
    fn root_ca_certs(&self) -> &[String];
    async fn update_trust_anchors(&mut self) -> Result<(), AttestationError>;
}
```

**Canonical Attestation Result:**
```rust
struct AttestationResult {
    vendor: String,                   // "intel-sgx", "aws-nitro", "arm-trustzone"
    enclave_measurement: Vec<u8>,    // MRENCLAVE / PCR
    quote_verified: bool,
    verified_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    revoke_check: RevocationStatus,  // Ok / Revoked / Unknown
    raw_quote: Option<Vec<u8>>,
    pck_chain: Option<String>,
}
```

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. **Rust for Core + Gateway**
   - Memory safety critical for attestation code
   - Excellent SGX/OP-TEE library support
   - Zero-cost abstractions for performance

### 2. **Solidity for Smart Contracts**
   - EigenLayer/EigenDA compatibility
   - Mature tooling (Foundry, Hardhat)
   - Large auditor pool

### 3. **Canonical CBOR over Protobuf**
   - Simpler canonicalization rules
   - Smaller binary size
   - Better Rust ecosystem support

### 4. **Ed25519 over ECDSA-p256**
   - Faster signing in enclave (20x)
   - Deterministic signatures (no RNG needed)
   - 32-byte keys (smaller storage)

### 5. **EigenDA for Anchoring**
   - 100x cheaper than L1 ($0.05/batch vs $50)
   - 10-minute latency acceptable for audit use case
   - EigenLayer cryptoeconomic security

## Cost Analysis

### Development Costs (Already Incurred)

- Phase 0 implementation: ~3 days (design + critical path)
- **Estimated remaining:** 10-14 weeks for full MVP

### Infrastructure Costs (Production)

**Monthly:**
- Gateway (3x AWS t3.large): $300
- PostgreSQL RDS (db.t3.medium): $150
- Kafka MSK (3 brokers): $200
- S3 storage (1TB): $23
- **Total:** ~$670/month (supports 1000+ robots)

**On-Chain (per mission with EigenDA):**
- 10 checkpoints/mission × $0.05/batch ÷ 1000 per batch = **$0.0005/mission**
- Model registration (one-time): $0.04

## How to Build On This Foundation

### 1. Start with Enclave TA (OP-TEE)

```bash
# Clone OP-TEE build environment
git clone https://github.com/OP-TEE/build.git
cd build
make -j$(nproc) toolchains

# Copy attestation TA skeleton to optee_examples
cp -r ../humanoid_labs/hacks/enclave/optee/ optee_examples/attestation_ta/

# Build
make attestation_ta
```

### 2. Test Checkpoint Creation

```bash
cd humanoid_labs/hacks
cargo test -p attestation-core test_checkpoint_signature_verification -- --nocapture
```

### 3. Deploy Contracts to Testnet

```bash
cd smart-contracts

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys

# Deploy to Sepolia
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
    --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL \
    --broadcast \
    --verify
```

### 4. Integrate with ROS2

```bash
cd ros_package
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run attestation_node attestation_node
```

## Open Questions / Design Choices to Make

1. **EigenDA vs L2?** (Cost vs latency tradeoff)
   - Recommendation: Start with EigenDA for cost, add L1 fallback for critical events

2. **Key Rotation Period?** (90 days vs 180 days)
   - Recommendation: 90 days for gateway, enclave keys are ephemeral

3. **Sensor Sampling Rate?** (10Hz vs 1Hz vs on-event)
   - Recommendation: Configurable, default 1Hz with event-triggered high-rate

4. **Disclosure Threshold?** (3-of-5 vs 2-of-3 key shares)
   - Recommendation: 3-of-5 (legal + ops + compliance + auditor + customer)

5. **ZK Proofs?** (Immediate vs Phase 2)
   - Recommendation: Phase 2; Merkle proofs sufficient for MVP

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 0 is complete.** The critical architectural components are implemented:

- ✅ Canonical serialization (deterministic hashing)
- ✅ Anti-rollback protection (3-layer design)
- ✅ Attestation abstraction (multi-vendor support)
- ✅ Smart contracts (registry + revocation)
- ✅ Threat model (18 threats analyzed)

**Next immediate step:** Implement the OP-TEE Trusted Application to enable end-to-end checkpoint signing on real hardware. This is the critical path to a working MVP.

**Timeline to MVP:** 10-12 weeks with focused effort.

**Timeline to Production:** 6 months including security audits.
